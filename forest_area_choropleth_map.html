        <h1> Visualisation of the 2019-20 Australian Bushfires </h1>
    </center>
    <h2> Domain </h2>
    <p> The domain of the visualisation is natural disasters, specifically bushfires. </p>
    <h2> Dataset </h2>
    <p> 
        The dataset is taken from <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/data-by-topic/fire 
        " target="_blank">Forests Australia</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first attribute is state which is of type nominal and represents a grouping.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second attribute is proportion of total forest area that has been burnt. The attribute type 
        is quantitative as it is numerical and we can perform arithmetic operations with it. 
    </p>
    <h2> Data Transformations </h2>
    <p> No data transformations were applied. A normalised field (proportion as %) was already present. </p>
    <h2> Justification for Idiom Type </h2>
    <p>
        I have used a choropleth map to effectively show a numerical attribute for each geographic region (state). 
        The values have importantly been normalised by total forest area for each state. The choropleth map allows us
        to easily and effectively identify and compare geographic regions and how they have been affected by the 
        2019-20 bushfire season.
